1. **TFontButton** Control - A button which supports a font glyph instead of a graphic image.
2. **TSmoothMove** Component - Event-driven component to manage the movement of controls or values in general. 
  1. Comparable to the "Float Animations" available in Firemonkey.
3. **TPageMenu** Control - A custom control to switch between pages. 
  1. Similar to, but far different from, a THeaderControl.
4. **TImageGrid** Control - A custom control to display a list of custom-drawn images.
5. **TSideMenu** Control - A custom control to display a main menu on the left side.
6. **[TJDWeather](TJDWeather.md)** - A component to retrieve weather information from various different weather services.
