# JDLib
JD Library of Custom Components and Controls, written by Jerry Dodge.

### NOTE:
This library is under active development, and is in no way complete, until further notice.

### Information:
JDLib is optimized for Delphi 10.4. It consists of the following components on the "JD Components" page:

- **[TJDFontButton](Docs/TJDFontButton.md)** Control - A button which supports a font glyph instead of a graphic image.
-  **[TJDSmoothMove](Docs/TJDSmoothMove.md)** Component - Event-driven component to manage the movement of controls or values in general. 
    - Comparable to the "Float Animations" available in Firemonkey.
- **TJDPageMenu** Control - A custom control to switch between pages. 
    - Similar to, but far different from, a THeaderControl.
- **TJDImageGrid** Control - A custom control to display a list of custom-drawn images.
- **TJDSideMenu** Control - A custom control to display a main menu on the left side.
- **[TJDGauge](Docs/TJDGauge.md)** Control - A dynamic and customizable gauge control.
- **TJDFontGlyph**
