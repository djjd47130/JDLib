# JDLib
JD Library of Custom Components and Controls

### NOTE:
This library is under active development, and is in no way complete, until further notice.

### Information:
JDLib is optimized for Delphi 10 Seattle. It consists of the following components on the "JD Components" page:

1. **[TJDFontButton](Docs/TJDFontButton.md)** Control - A button which supports a font glyph instead of a graphic image.
2. **[TSmoothMove](Docs/TJDSmoothMove.md)** Component - Event-driven component to manage the movement of controls or values in general. 
  1. Comparable to the "Float Animations" available in Firemonkey.
3. **TJDPageMenu** Control - A custom control to switch between pages. 
  1. Similar to, but far different from, a THeaderControl.
4. **TJDImageGrid** Control - A custom control to display a list of custom-drawn images.
5. **TJDSideMenu** Control - A custom control to display a main menu on the left side.
6. **[TJDGauge](Docs/TJDGauge.md)** Control - A dynamic and customizable gauge control.
